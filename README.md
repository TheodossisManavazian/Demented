A Unity game where you run throug a procedurally generated dungeon killing monsters, collecting upgrades and getting stronger before fighting the final boss

This game was a project made by me along side 3 classmates in 2022. All the assets you see were 100% made by my team and I in blender and gimp.

The game uses a marching cubes algorithm to generate the world. with each level increasing the games difficulty and world size.
You play through the dungeon where you have to destroy chests in order to get upgrades that can increase your: speed, health, firing rate, and damage.
Before being able to continue on to the next dungeon you must take care of all the enemies in the current dungeon.


My team and I had a great time creating this project. Given we all had very limited experience with game design, C# and Unity all together, our struggle did not deter us it motivated us!
